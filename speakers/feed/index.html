				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elizabeth is a researcher and user experience consultant based in the United Kingdom. She is in the final year of a PhD program in Media and Communication Design at Northumbria University, a three-year excursion into academia after more than 35 years in industry, and she plans to return to consulting practice in the autumn.</p>
<p>Elizabeth has conducted user research and interaction design for projects in the US, the UK, and Italy and has focused on government systems (with a few non-profit and commercial systems thrown in for good measure). Her government projects have ranged from public websites to internal social media web apps to touchscreen kiosks to spacecraft control centers; their user populations have ranged from the worldwide general public to the astronauts on board the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Elizabeth is the co-editor, with Dianne Murray, of <strong><a href="http://is.gd/uxgov">Usability in Government Systems: User Experience Design for Citizens and Public Servants</a></strong>, the only book that addresses the intersection of UX and government systems.</p>
